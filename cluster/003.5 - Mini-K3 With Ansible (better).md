## The Flow

### What I did
1) Download Raspberry Pi Image
2) Boot into it and utilize `sudo raspi-config`
	1) modify the `hostname`, `enable SSH`, and install a backdoor SSH key :)
3) Used the following dd command to create a bootable image this from `cluster00`
	```bash
	sudo pv -B 32m /dev/sdb | dd of=$HOME/Desktop/raspberry.img bs=512 conv=sparse 
	```
4) To use the dd image:
    ```bash
	sudo dd if=raspberry.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1024k status=progress
	```
	
### Post install process
1) Change hostname using `sudo raspi-config`
2) Add the following line to `/boot/cmdline.txt`
	1) `cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory`
3) Follow these [steps](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/installing-k3s-kubernetes-on-turing-pi-raspberry-pi-cluster-episode-3)
```markdown
1.  Download using the 'Download ZIP' link on GitHub on [https://github.com/rancher/k3s-ansible](https://github.com/rancher/k3s-ansible)
2.  Edit the Ansible inventory file `inventory/hosts.ini`, and replace the examples with the IPs or hostnames of your master and nodes. This file describes the K3s masters and nodes to Ansible as it installs K3s.
3.  Edit the `inventory/group_vars/all.yml` file and change the `ansible_user` to `pirate`.
4.  Run `ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini` and wait.
```
4) Install k3 with (note you are in the k3-ansible directory) 
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

6) Get kubernetes authentication token
```bash
scp pi@"$IPADDRESS":~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config-turing-pi
```
6) Add it to your `.bashrc` (or similar)
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-turing-pi
```

---
## Reset with ansible
```
ansible-playbook reset.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini
```

## Shutdown all Pi's
```
ansible all -i inventory/hosts.ini -a "shutdown now" -b
```
